# Notes
- prio no.1 is think of a good way to place e and s.
- think about just and algo selection screen that runs before the actual grid with the cursor taking up whole row
for each option.  (after base algo setup.)

- Add in s for start point. copy code for e.
- Could also add fn + arrkey to skip to top/bottom and far left/right.
- need to think about how user can draw blockers in a quick fashion one by one too slow and tedious to draw something meaningful.

- Got rectangle working. But it wont suffice. Need to get it to work with erow struct.
- Create the struct like in kilo.c and get it to work for one row.

- Also need to make rectangle one less row than it should be for a help bar at the bottom for controls.
