# Notes

- May need a play zone so borders don't interact with drawing game. Maybe if i was smart this wouldn't be an issue.


- Got rectangle working. But it wont suffice. Need to get it to work with erow struct.
- Create the struct like in kilo.c and get it to work for one row.

- Also need to make rectangle one less row than it should be for a help bar at the bottom for controls.
